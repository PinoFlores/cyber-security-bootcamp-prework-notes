## The need for a networking models



### What is a network?

A network is defined as having two or more computing devices interconnected, using a set of communication protocols (rules) that allow them to share a resource between themeselves.

#### What is a resource?

A resource can be anything, such as a file, a multiplayer game on an online server, and even a network-connected printer.


#### What is a network protocol?

A network protocol is simply the **rules and guidelines** that are used by a device to allow communication or the exchange of messages from one device to another.

There are many network protocols, each of which has a different purpose and characteristic.

#### TCP/IP Quick notes

**TCP/IP** is considered to be the universal language of communication within the networking industry.

## Models in Networking

Let's explore first about networking models.

### What is a Model in networking?

In networking, a model refers to a standardized approach to organizing and understanding how differents **network protocols** and technologies work together to facilitate communication between devices.

#### Most commonly used Models

There are severals models used in networking, but the most commonly used are:
- OSI
- TCP/IP
